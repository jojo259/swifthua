# To-do

- check sanitization of all api request functions
- allow setting timezone
- add traditional support for words on all pages depending on user settings
- list exporter with linking by query parameters
- add rate limiting
- re-write/remove bad/unused code from `app.py`
- add 'will be saved as ID X' info message when creating list
- change side button titles into actual hover-only text
- switch to some client-side rendering in order to avoid client-side state management (or do client-side state management i guess)?; or just add a "reload to refresh" button
- stop storing state in html in study.js
- revamp profile page
